# Exact Track

<!-- Primary functionality will be for Instructors and how they get in and what they do. Currently, this is a bit more like a 'Skyward' grade book and less like a 'Google Classroom.' -->

<!-- What is our MVP - MINIMALLY VIABLE PRODUCT?
  We are just managing a group of students in 1 single class.
